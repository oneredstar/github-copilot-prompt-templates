# Introduction

Welcome to the **GitHub Copilot Prompt Templates** library! This is a curated collection of prompt templates designed to help you get the most out of GitHub Copilot for common development tasks.

## What are Prompt Templates?

Prompt templates are pre-written, structured prompts that guide GitHub Copilot to generate high-quality code, documentation, tests, and reviews. By using well-crafted prompts, you can:

- **Save time** - Avoid writing the same prompts repeatedly
- **Improve consistency** - Get predictable, high-quality results
- **Learn best practices** - See how to effectively communicate with AI coding assistants
- **Accelerate development** - Focus on solving problems rather than prompt engineering

## How to Use This Library

1. **Browse the templates** - Explore categories like Code Review, Testing, and Documentation
2. **Copy and adapt** - Take a template and customize it for your specific needs
3. **Save favorites** - Keep frequently used templates in your own collection
4. **Contribute back** - Share your own effective prompts with the community

## Template Categories

### Agent Workflows
Templates for GitHub Copilot agents to handle complex workflows like requirements writing and disciplined ticket implementation with clear execution rules.

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of using a template:

1. Navigate to [Requirements Writing](/docs/templates/agent-workflows/requirements-writing)
2. Copy the example prompt
3. Replace placeholders with your actual requirements
4. Use it in GitHub Copilot Chat to generate comprehensive tickets

## Repository Structure

- **`templates/`** - Canonical source of all prompt templates (Markdown files)
- **`website/`** - Docusaurus site for browsing templates
- **`website/docs/`** - Documentation pages (mirrors template content)
